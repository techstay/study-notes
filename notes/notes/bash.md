Bash is a widely used Linux shell, and almost all Linux distributions come with Bash pre-installed. Therefore, many people choose Bash when writing Linux shell scripts to achieve the best compatibility. However, as a scripting language designed quite early, Bash also has many shortcomings. So here I will just learn some basic usage to handle simple needs. If you encounter complex tasks, it is better to use a more powerful scripting language like Python, which is more powerful, easier to develop with, and offers better performance.

## Development Environment

When writing scripts in VS Code, you need to install the `shell-format` and `ShellCheck` extensions to help check for errors in Bash scripts and format your scripts.

## Learning Resources

- <https://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/index.html>, a relatively comprehensive beginner's guide, though a bit outdated.
- <https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/bash-scripting-tutorial-linux-shell-script-and-command-line-for-beginners/>, a simple article introducing some Bash usage tips.
- <https://guide.bash.academy/>, this tutorial is good, with detailed diagrams for each shell syntax, but it was not yet finished.
